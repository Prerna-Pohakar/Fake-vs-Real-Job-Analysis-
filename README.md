# Fake-vs-Real-Job-Analysis

**Fake vs Real Job Postings Analysis Dashboard
📝 Project Overview**

This project is my first internship data analytics project, where I analyzed fake vs real job postings to identify fraud patterns in online recruitment data.
The complete workflow covers data cleaning in Excel and data visualization in Power BI, resulting in an interactive dashboard that highlights key fraud indicators.



**🎯 Objective**

Identify the percentage of fake job postings

Analyze how fake jobs vary by:

Employment type

Industry

Location (On-site / Remote)

Company logo availability

Calculate an overall Fraud Risk Score

Present insights through a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard



**🛠 Tools & Technologies Used**

Microsoft Excel

Data cleaning

Data validation

Pivot tables & pivot charts

Power BI

Data modeling

DAX measures

Interactive dashboard & slicers

DAX

Fake Job Percentage

Fraud Risk Score

KPI calculations



**🧹 Data Cleaning (Excel)**

The raw dataset was cleaned in Excel before importing into Power BI:

Removed duplicate records

Standardized employment type values

Cleaned industry and location fields

Converted binary fields (fake / real)


**Created clean columns:**

clean_is_fake

clean_location

clean_has_logo

Verified data using Pivot Tables



**📈 Dashboard Features**

The Power BI dashboard includes:

KPI Cards

Around 51% of job postings are fake, indicating high fraud risk

Remote jobs show a higher fake job ratio

Job postings without company logos are more likely to be fake

Certain industries and employment types show higher fraud concentration

Overall Fraud Risk Score = 0.58, indicating moderate-to-high risk
